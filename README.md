This folder contains code and data to reproduce the results in the associated paper. In particular, the provided scripts will reproduce all graphs.

Open main.mlx file using MATLAB
## step 1
change your working path to `...\SBI\RUN`;

add your UQlab package core path `...\UQlab\UQLab_Rel2.0.0\UQLab_Rel2.0.0\core`;

add your subroutine code path `...\SBI\Main\subroutines`;

Run Matlab;

## step 2
Cases A, B, C are cases using different source of observations:A - only pile displacement; B - only reaction force, or C - both. 

To change between cases, we just need to change the data we used, and all the input data are put in the folder "input/csv/..."

Case A: Copy the data from folder "Cases/CaseA" to the current path "input/csv/..."; 

Case B: Copy the data from folder "Cases/CaseB" to the current path "input/csv/..."; 

Case C: Copy the data from folder "Cases/CaseC" to the current path "input/csv/..."; 

Also we need to change the weight for the model discrepancy, we just need to change the data we used, and all the input data are put in the folder "input/mat/..."

Case A: Copy the data from folder "Cases/CaseA" to the current path "input/mat/..."; 

Case B: Copy the data from folder "Cases/CaseB" to the current path "input/mat/..."; 

Case C: Copy the data from folder "Cases/CaseC" to the current path "input/mat/..."; 

## step 3
click run

# Requirements <a name="Requirements"></a>
The following functions used in the scripts require toolboxes to be installed:
1. UQLab packages for MCMC https://www.uqlab.com/
2. Matlab 2024 (HPC also supported)
3. Statistics and Machine learning toolbox;Optimization toolbox;Global Optimization toolbox
